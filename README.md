## Description
In this mission, game mode "ground support", the players take the roles of helicopter pilots tasked with supporting ground units. The playing field includes the two bases of each factions, as well as a total of 10 sectors. From these faction bases ground units are always on their way to independently seize control of those 10 active sectors. The players are there to support the groups by answering requests for transport, air support or medical evacuation. These orders are dynamically generated during the game, which means that no round compared to another is completely equal. This is accompanied by immersive radio traffic.

The mission ends as soon as one side has no more tickets remaining. These are reduced when helicopters crash or the opponent controls at least 6 sectors. In the event of a helicopter crash, the player can respawn at their respective base, where after some time the helicopters reappear. The base also provides landing sites to repair, refuel or rearm the helicopter during the mission. Players are actually restricted to their role as pilots and can only leave the vehicle within their own base, for example, to switch to another helicopter. This also means that players themselves cannot take any sectors.

Each side also has a Jet in their base. This won't respawn, so it's a high valuable asset with which you can interrupt the enemy supply lines.

You can adjust parameters in the lobby for the daytime, weather, tickets count and view distance.

There are 3 kinds of infantry troops which will ask for support:
* Ghost (4 soldiers)
* Nomad (8 soldiers)
* Hydra (16 soldiers)
